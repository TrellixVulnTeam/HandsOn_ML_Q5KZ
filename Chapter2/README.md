## General info
This chapter is about an example project end to end. The main steps of such a process are:
1. Look at the big picture
2. Get the data
3. Discover and visualize the data to get insights
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms
5. Select a model and train it
6. Fine-tune your model
7. Present your solution
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system

Dataset used will be the California Housing Prices dataset - titled houses.zip -
from the [StatLib] (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/) repository
